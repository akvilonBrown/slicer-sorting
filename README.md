# slicer-sorting
Slicer extension to sort and break down regular arrays of objects (created for pre-segmented seeds, but not limited to)

This is a beta version of the extension, and it can be installed in Developer mode, so users should download/clone the folder with the code and add it from the [Extension Wizard](https://slicer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/modules/extensionwizard.html).

The detailed Wiki is not ready yet.
The short demo video is only available in video/slicer_recording.mp4
